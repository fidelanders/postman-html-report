# 🧪 Postman JSON to HTML Reporting Tool

A lightweight and user-friendly reporting tool that converts Postman test results (in JSON format) into a clean, visually appealing HTML dashboard with options to download reports as PDF. Built for QA engineers and developers who want to present test results in a clear, shareable format.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was born out of the need for better visibility and presentation of API test results generated by Postman. While Postman provides basic reporting features, they are often not customizable, exportable, or presentable for stakeholders. This tool transforms raw JSON test reports exported from Postman into an HTML dashboard that can be:
- Shared across teams
- Downloaded as a styled PDF
- Easily interpreted by both technical and non-technical stakeholders

## ✅ Key Features

- 🔄 **Postman JSON Parser**: Parses Postman collection runner's exported `.json` result files.
- 🖥️ **Interactive HTML Report**: Automatically renders a styled, responsive dashboard with test suite summaries.
- 📄 **PDF Export**: One-click PDF download functionality.
- 🌐 **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive layout for seamless use on all screen sizes.
- 🎨 **Customizable Themes** *(Upcoming)*: Change color schemes and branding styles.
- 📊 **Visual Breakdown**: Success/failure rate, error logs, and test durations visualized with charts.
